# Feedback & Known Issues

## Bot Feedback Template
When reporting issues, include:
- What command/action you ran
- Job ID / Event ID
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshot/log snippet

## Recommended feedback channel
Use your Discord `#bot-feedback` channel (or your chosen tracker).

## Known caveats
- End-to-end UI validation still depends on Discord permissions/context.
- If Scheduled Event permissions are missing, event auto-create/sync can fail.
